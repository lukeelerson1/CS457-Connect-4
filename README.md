## Project Title: Connect 4 - ONLINE PEW PEW POW THE ACTION GAME BWAHHHHHHH

**Team:** Lukas Elerson

## Project Objective
To create an online, browser-based Connect 4 game.

## Scope

### Inclusions
- Online connectivity
- Simple browser-based GUI
- Basic Connect Four functionality
- Server-Client Architecture: The game must implement a clear server-client architecture, with the server handling game state and communication between clients.
- Game Logic: The game must accurately implement the rules of the game (as defined in your SOW):
Alternating turns between players.Determining the winner.
Handling draw conditions.
-Multiplayer Capability: The game should allow multiple clients to connect and play simultaneously.
Error Handling: The game should gracefully handle common errors, such as network failures, invalid input, or unexpected game states.

### Exclusions
- None

## Deliverables
- Fully functioning Python script to handle game mechanics
- Optional: GUI implemented using an HTML library if not handled by the Python script
